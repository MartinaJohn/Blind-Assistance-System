# Blind-Assistance-System
- The Blind Assistance System is designed to aid visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings more efficiently and safely.
- The project employs machine learning algorithms implemented using TensorFlow Object Detection API and OpenCV to detect and classify objects in real-time video feed from a camera.
- The SSD architecture is used to ensure fast and accurate detection of objects, while Pygame provides an audio feedback system for the user.
